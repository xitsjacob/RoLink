  <h1>RoLink Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: July 18th, 2024</p>

  <p>Thank you for using our RoLink! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your
    information when you use our bot ("Bot"). Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of
    this policy, please do not use the Bot.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Discord User Information:</strong> We may collect and store certain information about your Discord account
    necessary to operate the Bot effectively. This may include your username, user ID, avatar, and discriminator.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Server Information:</strong> The Bot may collect information about the Discord servers you invite it to,
    such as server ID, name, and member list.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Command Usage:</strong> We may collect information regarding the commands you use with the Bot for
    statistical or troubleshooting purposes. This may include command history and context but does not include the
    content of your conversations.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <p>
    We use the information we collect to operate, maintain, and improve the Bot's functionality and performance. This
    may include analyzing usage trends, providing personalized content, and responding to user inquiries and support
    requests.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

  <p>
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties without your consent, except as set
    forth in this Privacy Policy or required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Security of Your Information</h2>

  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method
    of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
    security.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational,
    legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Continued
    use of the Bot after any changes to this Privacy Policy signifies your consent to such changes.
